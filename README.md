# WebStudio-1.0--before-courses-


1. The motivation to complete the bottom task has become - the desire to test one's own strengths and one's (so far not more) knowledge.

2. I took this task from the course on which I started but have not yet begun. In the future, having completed the same task under the control of mentors and the knowledge that I will receive on the course, I will compare the quality of this task before and after the course.

3. The task was also completed for the purposes of personal practice (which is very important in the learning process).

4. There is nothing remarkable in my mini-project, because I am still just learning.

Thank you for your attention!
